# Titanic Survival Prediction

This project, by **skisenge01edukisumu**, predicts whether a passenger on the Titanic survived or not. It's a classic machine learning project based on the Kaggle competition of the same name.

## Feature Engineering

This project heavily relies on feature engineering to improve the model's performance. The following features were created:

- **`Title`**: Extracted from the passenger's name (e.g., Mr, Mrs, Miss, Master).
- **`FamilySize`**: The total number of family members on board (SibSp + Parch + 1).
- **`IsAlone`**: A boolean indicating if the passenger was traveling alone.
- **`AgeGroup`**: Age grouped into bins (Child, Teen, Young, Adult, Senior).
- **`FareBin`**: Fare grouped into quartiles.
- **`FarePerPerson`**: Fare per person in the family.
- **`Deck`**: The deck the passenger was on, extracted from the cabin number.
- **Interaction Features**: 
    - `Age_Class`: Interaction between Age and Pclass.
    - `Fare_Class`: Interaction between Fare and Pclass.
    - `Sex_Class`: Interaction between Sex and Pclass.
- **`IsWomanOrChild`**: A boolean indicating if the passenger is a woman or a child.

## Model and Results

The project explores several models, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting. The final model is a weighted ensemble of the following models:
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting
- Extra Trees

The ensemble model achieves a cross-validation score of **82.49%**.

### Leaderboard Score

The best score achieved on the Kaggle leaderboard was **0.78947** with a previous version of the model (Logistic Regression). The pipeline in this project is an improved version and is expected to score higher.

### Test Set Score

The final submission file (`submission_ensemble.csv`) generated by the pipeline in `notebook/main.ipynb` is expected to achieve a score of **~82.5%** on the private leaderboard. This is based on the cross-validation score of the ensemble model.

## Installation

To run this project, you need to have Python 3 and pip installed. Then, you can install the required dependencies from `requirements.txt`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

The main code is in the Jupyter Notebook `notebook/main.ipynb`. To run it, you can start the Jupyter Notebook server:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

Then, open `notebook/main.ipynb` in your browser. The notebook will guide you through the process of data exploration, feature engineering, model training, and submission.
